# Suicide Barrels
This gamemode is like a Zombie infestation gamemode where there is one barrel who has to explode itself and kill as many Humans as it can. If a Human dies, they get to respawn as a barrel and try to eliminate the remaining humans. Meanwhile, the Humans have to survive until the timer is up. Luckily, they can use live firearms. If at least 1 Human is alive before the timer is up, the Humans win. If every Human is dead before the timer is up, then the Barrels win. It's as simple as that.
